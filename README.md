# Desktop E-Paper Todoist Display

This project is a simple way to display your Todoist tasks on an e-paper display. The display is updated every 30 seconds with the current time, and every 5 minutes with the latest tasks from your Todoist account.

The project is built using a cheap 4.2-inch Waveshare e-paper display, and an ESP8266 WaveShare e-paper driver board, and the Todoist API.
